      question: 'How do I know the tickets are genuine?',
      answer: 'All tickets on LayLow-India are verified through our multi-step authentication process. We use QR code verification, seller KYC, and escrow payments to ensure authenticity.

      id: 'faq2',
      question: 'What if the event gets cancelled?',
      answer: 'If an event is cancelled or significantly altered, you\'re eligible for a full refund. We process refunds within 5-7 working days to your original payment method.

      id: 'faq4',
      question: 'What payment methods do you accept?',
      answer: 'We accept all major payment methods including UPI, credit/debit cards, net banking, and digital wallets like Paytm, PhonePe, and Google Pay.

      id: 'faq5',
      question: 'Can I sell my tickets on LayLow-India?',
      answer: 'Yes! You can easily list your tickets for sale. Simply create an account, verify your identity through our KYC process, and upload your ticket details. Our platform handles the payment processing and ticket transfer. Sellers receive payment after the event is successfully completed, ensuring buyer satisfaction.'
    },
    {
      id: 'faq6',
      question: 'What is your refund policy?',
      answer: 'We offer a buyer-first refund policy in compliance with the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.

Refunds are processed in 5-7 working days to your original payment method.'
    },
    {
      id: 'faq7',
      question: 'How do you verify sellers?',
      answer: 'All sellers undergo a comprehensive verification process including KYC (Know Your Customer) verification, PAN card validation, and bank account verification. We also monitor seller behavior and transaction history. Sellers with verified accounts receive special badges and higher trust scores, making them more visible to buyers.'
    },
    {
      id: 'faq8',
      question: 'Is my personal information secure?',
      answer: 'Absolutely. We comply with the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011. Your data is encrypted using 256-bit SSL encryption, stored on secure servers within India, and never shared with unauthorized third parties. We use the same security protocols as major banks.'
    },
    {
      id: 'faq9',
      question: 'What happens if I can\'t attend the event?',
      answer: 'If you can\'t attend an event, you can resell your ticket on our platform. Simply list it for sale and we\'ll handle the transfer process. However, please note that refunds are not available for buyer\'s remorse if the ticket was valid and the event occurred as scheduled. We recommend checking event details carefully before purchasing.'
